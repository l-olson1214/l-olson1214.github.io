        <h2>
            Meet Grey
        </h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! Welcome to my (work in progress) website! <br/>
            I'm currently an iOS Software Engineer at WillowTree, 
            living in Columbus, OH. I've gotten to work on a couple of really
            cool interesting projects, ranging from creating stunning UI for 
            an onboarding flow to architecting analytics for over 100+ other 
            iOS engineers to use.
            
            <br/> <br/>
            So who am I? <br/>
            I'm someone with a passion for art and all things crafty - 
            please talk to me about making stuffed animals as I learn 
            all of the intricacies of sewing. (My grandma would be proud) <br/>
            I have a dog that I love dearly, she's a feral dog turned CGC, 
            trick dog, and lover of sitting on people despite being 60lbs. <br/>
            At work, when not coding, I love to help lead the ERG (Employee 
            Resource Group), plan fun events, and deep dive into learning about
            UI/UX, design, or other coding focuses. 
        </p>
